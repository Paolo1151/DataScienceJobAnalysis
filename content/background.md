Despite Data Scienctists being a valuable asset to many companies, the field of Data Science is not an exception from the phenomenon known as "Brain Drain". According to its definition in Merriam Webster:

> ### Brain Drain
> "The departure of educated or professional people from one country, economic sector, or field for another usually for better pay or living conditions"
