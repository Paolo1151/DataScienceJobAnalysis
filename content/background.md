## Introduction

Being a Data Scientist is heavily coveted in this society where being data-driven has had a huge impact in the way various industries make decisions. According to Davenport and Patil, Data Science is "The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century" for the job being highly in demand due to the qualities that a Data Scientist can provide for a company. 

Despite Data Scientists being a valuable asset to many companies, the field of Data Science is not an exception from the phenomenon known as "Brain Drain". According to its definition in Merriam Webster:

> ### Brain Drain
> "The departure of educated or professional people from one country, economic sector, or field for another usually for better pay or living conditions"

This phenomena is a major concern for the local job market as this limits local company's opportunities to hire Data Scientists and find the best talent for their company.

## Research Questions and Objectives

With this, this project aims to answer the following questions:

* How does the Salary amongst Data Science Jobs throughout the years in terms of Experience Level and Field?
* Where do Data Scientists go to work coming from a country of origin?


The purpose of this study is to be able to:

* Understand the trends in the Data Science Salaries in terms of experience level and Field
* Understand Data Scientist Migration Patterns

## Scope and Limitations

The Data used in this study is limited to the dataset provided from Kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries).

## Methodology

{METHOD PICTURE}

This study will follow a simple procedure to answer the questions. As with any dataset, the dataset is preprocessed and new features based on domain knowledge are added before any analysis is done. Once the dataset is cleaned, basic graphs are created and examined in order to understand the dataset and the trends in the Data Science Market. Lastly, to understand Data Scientist Migration Patterns, a Markov Chain is graphed and analyzed to determine the probability of a Data Scientist migrating from one country to another.
