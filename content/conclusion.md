## Conclusion

This study revealed some interesting facts about Data Science Salaries and also the Migration Patterns of Data Scientists across the world. The Salaries seem to be trending upwards. As expected, the data scientists with the lower pay are those with least experience. In terms of the Data Science Market, ther is quite a lack of Senior and Expert Level Data Scientists at the Start of 2020. However, the market seems to be catching up as there are more records for 2021 and 2021 for missing roles. Further more, the distribution of mean salaries across the different fields seem to be quite even, thus Data Scientists are more free to choose which role they want to play. 

## Recommendations and Further Studies

For further studies, there may be a study on the human development index. Do data Scientists who migrate tend to go to places where the human development index is higher? That might be an interesting question to answer which could show a relationship between human development index and the probability of a Data Scientist Staying. 

Furthermore, since the study was limited to looking at the networks with the top 5 amount of samples, it didnt get to see the migration patterns of data scientists from countries like the Philippines or Japan due to the lack of samples. Perhaps more data collection in regards of this topic, which is publically available, is good to improve the insights I generated here.
