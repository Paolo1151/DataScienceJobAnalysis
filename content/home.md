# An Analysis of Data Science Job Salaries and Data Scientist Migration Patterns

Welcome to my analysis of Data Science Job Salaries and Data Scientist Migration Patterns! How much do Data Scientists earn? Do Data Scientists tend to stay in their country or tend to migrate to other countries? In this analysis, we take a look at these questions and provide an answer through a [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries) provided by Ruchi Bahatia in Kaggle. This Application consists of two parts: My Analysis of the Dataset and an Interactive Dashboard that users can use to explore the data. With all that said, I hope you find this analysis useful and interesting!
